For example, a study of over 7,000 students, found that victims of bullying reported internalising symptoms including frequent worries, sadness, nervousness, and fearfulness (Peskin et al., 2007).\nIn a recent cross continental study of 317,869 adolescents 30.5% experienced bullying victimisation in the past 30 days (Biswas et al., 2020).\nA 2020 survey found that one in four workers have experienced bullying/ exclusion (Rosling, 2020).\nüíî What Makes Bullying Painful Let‚Äôs pinpoint what is the most painful about bullying victimisation. One might imagine that the worst thing about being bullied is the actual momentary experience. However, the root of the pain seems to lie elsewhere.\nLet‚Äôs take a hypothetical bullying victim named Lisa. Lisa is walking to school and a drunken homeless man walks past her and calls her ‚Äúidiot‚Äù. She continues walking and doesn‚Äôt think much of it. After all, he is clearly intoxicated and probably said this because he has his own mental turmoils to deal with, she thinks to herself. Later that day, Lisa is confronted by a fellow pupil named Natasha, who calls her ‚Äúidiot‚Äù. Lisa is plagued by what Natasha said to her for the rest of the day. What did Lisa do that made Natasha see her in this way, was it the way she gave a class presentation the day before or was is the way she asked a question in first period? Whatever it was Lisa clearly needs to change something about herself, she thinks. After school at dinner, Lisa talks of the interaction with the homeless man, brushing it off humorously with a comment about his state. She does not however talk of her interaction with Natasha. Why? Because she is ashamed. Lisa is ashamed of whatever she must have done to make Natasha see her in this light.\nWhile in reality bullying interactions aren‚Äôt quite as simple and often take the shape of innuendos and subtle exclusion or disrespect. I have simplified Lisa‚Äôs example to demonstrate the proposed view.\nThe interaction with the homeless man did not bother Lisa much because she attributed his comment to his own troubles and not her input.What upset Lisa about Natasha‚Äôs remark was Lisa‚Äôs believe that it was her own input that caused Natasha‚Äôs remark. To reiterate, it was not Natasha‚Äôs remark that plagued Lisa, but Lisa‚Äôs believe about it.\nIn my experience, this is the case for many bullying victims, even if they might not immediately be able to put this into words. Still, even if we do assume that it is the belief, it still doesn‚Äôt tell us how to help someone alleviate the pain it causes.\n‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π Resolve the Pain Sticking to Lisa‚Äôs example, let‚Äôs suppose she would have been of the impression that Natasha has childhood traumas that cause her to randomly call others names. Lisa would likely not feel shame for having caused the remark. If anything, Lisa is more likely to feel sympathy for Natasha and the internal struggles this remark might be a result of.\nHerein lies the answer of a possible way to alleviate maybe the most devastating pain felt by many bullying victims. To remedy the problematic belief, let‚Äôs create a replacing rational belief.\nüí• Steps to Build a New Awareness The goal is to break down the problematic belief and build up the rational new one, so that the victim can face the situation with internal security. Based on current research results I suggest the following steps:\n Break Down Problematic Belief- It is impossible that I alone could have caused this situation. Change Critical Focus- I will not change my self perception, I will change my perception of those showing bulling behavior. Rational Replacing Believe- I am secure in the face of adversity.  üôà Break Down Problematic Belief The aim is; to understand that one self is not the problem. The victim‚Äôs believe that they are at fault can easily be contradicted by accepting that this situation could only be a result of several factors. These include factors out of the victims control such as the layout of social groups. There is little research on how layout of social groups differently predict bullying/exclusion but in my experience rates are more likely in larger social groups. Still, bullying occurs in all kinds of social groups. Many times bullying victims are spiralled into being targeted by a larger number of people, kicked off by few initial people picking on the victim and others joining in. This can be especially challenging. In this instance one should simply accept that this could have easily happened to others, had their situation the same factors.\nüî≠ Change Critical Focus The victim‚Äôs critical attention of the situation should also be adjusted. Only changing one‚Äôs self perception because one is the victim of someone‚Äôs bullying behavior is rather irrational. If anything a bullying situation should inform the victim‚Äôs view of the bullies and the kinds of people they are around. The victims should trust their own self perception over those of others, who are clearly trying to cause an emotional reaction. In other words, the victim should not take the bullying personally, understanding that people‚Äôs behavior is largely impacted by their personal goings-on.\nüîë Rational Replacing Believe The new believe should imply that although this is an uncomfortable challenge of a situation, it brings the opportunity to respond with confidence in oneself in the face of difficulty. One should be aware that there are people with different intentions around one. Unless their intentions are to genuinely help one, their input should not be trusted over one‚Äôs own perception. Above all the victim should be secure in their own intuition with a self trust not affected by others, in particular those who clearly trying use one for social stunts of bullying.\n","wordCount":"989","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-11-23T23:12:03+01:00","dateModified":"2021-11-23T23:12:03+01:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Laila"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://lailascoaching.com/1233/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Laila's Coaching.com","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://lailascoaching.com/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script>
