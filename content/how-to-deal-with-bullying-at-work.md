**Irrationally, workplace bullying is underreported and less present in discussions about bullying, despite how common it is.**

An analysis of 148 organisations worldwide, found that 49% showed evidence of bullying on a regular basis (Hodson, Roscigno, & Lopez, 2006).

In a US study 37% of workers reported being bullied at the workplace at some time during their careers (Namie, 2007).

Earnshaw and Cooper (1996) reported that up to a third of UK stress-related employment legal cases are as a result of workplace bullying.

## :microscope: What’s different about it

Workplace bullying can be more difficult to spot or reduce as it is unique in its subtlety, with it manifesting in indirect ways, for example using innuendos.

A study with 1,137 participants found that those who had not yet been bullied predicted that their reaction to being bullied at the workplace would be significantly more assertive than the reaction of participants who had been bullied actually was (Rayner, 1998).

One reason for this could be that workplace bullying is unique in the way it plays out in contrast to how a classic bullying scenario is often represented in people’s minds.

Out of reported workplace bullying instances only 8 % were physical bullying instances in in a study by (Einarssen et al., 1994), with the most common types being verbal and indirect.

As argued by (Rayner, Hoel, 1998), workplace bullying takes the shape of a wide range of subtle tactics. They group workplace bullying into the following categories:

•	threat to personal status (e.g. professional humiliation)
•	thread to personal standing (e.g. name- calling)
•	 isolation (e.g. social isolation)
•	overwork (e.g. unnecessary pressure) 
•	destabilisation (e.g. failure to give credit).

Often workplace bullying takes the shape of allusive remarks or hints, with suggestive or disparaging undertones. This oblique indirect technique of bullying can be especially challenging to manage.

It may be subtle, less obvious- almost to the extend where mentioning it or complaining about it could seem ‘ridiculous’.

## :satellite: Can it be predicted?

There seems to be a connection between bullying and the type of work environment. The likelihood that bullying occurs has been shown to be linked to leadership style and conflict between roles.

 An optimal circumstance for bullying to take place is a lack of effective leadership.

A study with 5,288 participants compared different types of leadership styles and found that unpredictable leadership (were punishment is delivered on leaders’ own terms independent of workers behaviours) had the strongest likelihood of predicting workplace bullying. 

 When there is conflict between roles or unclear roles, bullying may take place resulting in e.g. the victim overworking, being under credited or being prevented access to opportunities. 
 A 2008 study by Einarssen et al. found that role conflict was the most consistent condition reliably linked to bullying in different types of workplaces.

## :bellhop_bell: How to react

Instead of overcompensating into either an overly offensive or overly agreeable direction, react secure.

### :syringe: Reaction to Manipulation

For example, when confronted with someone you suspect may be trying to bully you into taking on an extra workload, reacting overly offensive (by e.g. making them accusations), can make you look insecure and is unlikely to prevent future bullying. If anything, this can increase bullying or result in you being socially excluded. 

On the other hand, if you were to react overly agreeable and very suggestable, possibly with the internal narrative of trying to avoid conflict, you will likely be exploited by this person and encourage others to take advantage of you as well.

In contrast, if you were to engage in a solution focused narrative and weigh out both your and their suggestions by pointing out what is the fairest or most efficient to everyone involved, makes you an active contender rather than a passive follower subject to other’s handling.

 In general, focusing on the whole situation and everyone involved rather than clearly just looking out for your own interests can represent you as a more trustworthy, reliable, aware and therefore a bad target for manipulation.

 #### :scroll: SEW acronym

When confronted with workplace bullying involving pressuring, exploitation or destabilisation use the SEW acronym:

•	Secure - React secure in your intuition, not overcompensating into either an agreeable nor an offensive direction, by immediately accepting or rejecting other’s suggestion.

•	Evaluating – Engage in a solution focused discussion in a rational evaluative manner.


•	Whole situation – Retain a focus on the whole situation and everyone involved, instead of just yourself, showing that you are aware of and consider the broader factors and are unsuited for manipulation.


### :right_anger_bubble: Reaction to Petty Humiliation

In the case of petty humiliation attacks, the approach, is also focused on internal security but nevertheless distinct. 

For example, when confronted with a co-worker publicly ridiculing your outfit, reacting overly offensive (by e.g. showing that you are offended and pointing out how out of line they are) can make you look insecure and inexperienced in dealing with conflict.

On the other hand, if you were to react overly agreeable and accommodating by making an excuse for the outfit and thereby inadvertently agreeing with the bully’s judgement of it can make you seem nervous and easily shaken, making it seem as though you have little trust in your personal judgment.

In contrast, if you were to react with a calm unaffected posterior, continue doing what you were doing, maybe even seem slightly amused and brush their comment off with a reciprocating comment playfully mocking something of theirs, presents you as secure, stable and not easily affected by other’s disapproval.

#### :scroll: SUB acronym

When confronted with workplace bullying involving humiliation, name calling and petty attacks use the SUB acronym:

•	Secure- React secure in yourself by not overcompensating into either an agreeable nor an offensive direction, by communicating that you are offended or nervous. 

•	Unaffected- Keep a stable unaffected posterior, showing that you are not easily affected by other’s disapproval.


•	Brush off - Brush them off with a calm playful reciprocating comment.


**In general, retain a security in your own judgement. Trust your personal insight over that of others especially if the other person likely does not have your interests at heart.**
