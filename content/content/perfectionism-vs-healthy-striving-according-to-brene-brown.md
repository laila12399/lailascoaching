**While perfectionism can lead to termoils, self-improvement can lead to a healthier more productive state of being.**

 Brené Brown explores this difference.

## :page_with_curl: Brown’s Approach

In her book [The Gifts of Imperfection]( https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00BS03LL6/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1), Brené Brown she writes –
“Healthy striving is self-focused: "How can I improve?" Perfectionism is other-focused: "What will they think?”

Her approach is centred around attempting to let go of living a ‘fake life’ for others and instead embracing your current self and your journey. 

„Healthy striving is about striving for internal goals and wanting to be our best selves. Perfectionism is not motivated internally. Perfectionism is about what people will think. And you do not see effective leaders in corporations sitting on an email for three hours to make sure it’s worded just perfectly. You don’t. They have work to get done.. You don’t see elite athletes letting themselves be discouraged by a bad workout or a single bad performance. It happens all the time. They’re accustomed to winning, they’re accustomed to losing. Once perfectionism becomes the goal, they’re out of the sport.“ – Brené Brown

## :speaking_head: Brené Brown on Perfectionism VS Healhty Stiving:

In her book [The Gifts of Imperfection]( https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00BS03LL6/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1), Brené Brown she writes –

“Perfectionism is not the same thing has striving to be your best. Perfectionism is the belief that if we live perfect, look perfect, and act perfect, we can minimize or avoid the pain of blame, judgement, and shame. It’s a shield. It’s a twenty-ton shield that we lug around thinking it will protect us when, in fact, it’s the thing that’s really preventing us from flight.”

“Perfectionism is all about perception—we want to be perceived as perfect. Ironically, there is no way to control perception. No matter how much time and energy we spend trying, it’s out of our hands. I once heard someone say, ‘What people think of me or say about me is none of my business.’ It’s hard, but I try to practice this.”

“E.E Cummings wrote, "To be nobody-but-yourself in a world which is doing its best, night and day, to make you everybody but yourself - means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight- and never stop fighting.”
