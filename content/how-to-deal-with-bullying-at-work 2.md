**Workplace bullying is underreported and not taken as serious as other types of bullying.**

An analysis of 148 organizations worldwide, found that 49% showed evidence of bullying regularly [^1].

In a US study, 37% of workers reported being bullied at the workplace at some time during their careers[^2].

 A 1996 study reported that up to a third of UK stress-related employment legal cases are as a result of workplace bullying[^3].

## :microscope: What’s different about it

Workplace bullying can be more difficult to spot or reduce as it is unique in its subtlety, with it manifesting in indirect ways, for example using innuendos (indirect comments or hints).

A study with 1,137 participants found that those who had not yet been bullied predicted that their reaction to being bullied at the workplace would be significantly more assertive than the reaction of participants who had been bullied actually was[^4].

One reason for this could be that workplace bullying is unique in the way it plays out in contrast to how a classic bullying scenario is often represented in people’s minds.

Out of reported workplace bullying instances, only 8% were physical bullying instances in a study with 1,974 respondents[^5], with the most common types being verbal and indirect.

As argued by (Rayner, Hoel, 1998)[^6], workplace bullying takes the shape of a wide range of subtle tactics. They group workplace bullying into the following categories:

• **threat to personal status** (e.g. professional humiliation)

• **thread to personal standing** (e.g. name-calling)

• **isolation** (e.g. social isolation)

• **overwork** (e.g. unnecessary pressure) 

• **destabilisation** (e.g. failure to give credit).

Often workplace bullying takes the shape of allusive remarks or hints, with suggestive or disparaging undertones. This oblique indirect technique of bullying can be especially challenging to manage.

It may be cunning and less obvious- almost to the extent where mentioning it or complaining about it could seem ‘ridiculous’.

## :satellite: Can it be predicted?

There seems to be a connection between bullying and the type of work environment. The likelihood that bullying occurs has been shown to be linked to leadership style and conflict between roles.

An optimal circumstance for bullying to take place is a lack of effective leadership.

A study with 5,288 participants compared different types of leadership styles and found that unpredictable leadership (were punishment is delivered on leaders’ own terms independent of workers' behaviors) had the strongest likelihood of predicting workplace bullying [^7]. 

When there is conflict between roles or unclear roles, bullying may take place resulting in e.g. the victim overworking, being under-credited, or being prevented access to opportunities. 
A 2008 study found that role conflict was the most consistent condition reliably linked to bullying in different types of workplaces[^5].

## :bellhop_bell: How to react

Instead of overcompensating into either an overly offensive or overly agreeable direction, react secure.

### :syringe: Reaction to Manipulation

For example, when confronted with someone you suspect may be trying to bully you into taking on an extra workload, reacting overly offensive (by e.g., making them accusations), can make you look insecure and is unlikely to prevent future bullying. If anything, this can increase bullying or result in you being socially excluded. 

On the other hand, if you were to react overly agreeable and very suggestible, possibly with the internal narrative of trying to avoid conflict, you will likely be exploited by this person and encourage others to take advantage of you as well.

In contrast, engaging in a solution-focused narrative and weighing out both your and their suggestions by pointing out what is the fairest or most efficient to everyone involved, makes you an active contender rather than a passive follower subject to others’ handling.

 In general, focusing on the whole situation and everyone involved rather than clearly just looking out for your own interests can represent you as more trustworthy, reliable, aware of broader factors and therefore a bad target for manipulation.

 #### :scroll: SEW Acronym

When confronted with workplace bullying involving pressuring, exploitation or destabilization use the SEW acronym:

• **Secure-** React secure in your intuition, not overcompensating into either an agreeable nor an offensive direction, by immediately accepting or rejecting other’s suggestions.

• **Evaluating-** Engage in a solution-focused discussion in a rational evaluative manner.


• **Whole situation-** Retain a focus on the whole situation and everyone involved, instead of just yourself, showing that you are aware of and consider the broader factors and are unsuited for manipulation.


### :right_anger_bubble: Reaction to Petty Humiliation

In the case of petty humiliation attacks, the approach is also focused on internal security but nevertheless distinct. 

For example, when confronted with a co-worker publicly ridiculing your outfit, reacting overly offensive (by e.g., showing that you are offended and pointing out how out of line they are) can make you look insecure and inexperienced in dealing with conflict.

On the other hand, if you were to react overly agreeable and accommodating by making an excuse for the outfit and thereby inadvertently agreeing with the bully’s judgment of it can make you seem nervous and easily shaken, making it seem as though you have little trust in your personal judgment.

In contrast, if you were to react with a calm unaffected front, continue doing what you were doing, maybe even seem slightly amused and brush their comment off with a reciprocating comment playfully mocking something of theirs, presents you as secure, stable and not easily affected by other’s disapproval.

#### :scroll: SUB Acronym

When confronted with workplace bullying involving humiliation, name-calling and petty attacks use the SUB acronym:

• **Secure-** React secure in yourself by not overcompensating into either an agreeable nor an offensive direction and thereby communicating that you are offended or nervous. 

• **Unaffected-** Keep a stable unaffected front, showing that you are not easily affected by others’ disapproval.


• **Brush off-** Brush them off with a calm playful reciprocating comment.


**In general, retain a security in your own judgment. Trust your personal insight over that of others who clearly do not have your interests at heart.**
