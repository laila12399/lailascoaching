**Popular advice on how to deal with bullies at school is not understanding of how most bullying situations actually play out and is in some cases even counterproductive.**

## :eye: How Much does School bullying Happen?

A Canadian study of 3,829 students aged 9- 14 found **41.8%** to have experienced bulling victimisation to some degree (Ashrafi et al, 2020).

A recent survey US study of 463 students, found that **37%** reported being bullied (Hicks et al., 2018). 

In a Chinese survey study of 95,873 students, **30.4%** reported being bullied at least one time (shuqing, 2020).

## :link: What can School bullying Lead To?

School bulling victimisation has been linked to various consequences. Here is some research on some common happenings.

### :eight_pointed_black_star: Emotional Consequences

Many of the consequences of school bulling victimisation are not confined to the momentary bulling experience but have more long-lasting impacts. For example:

•	generally **higher Anxiety** (Baldry et al., 2004)

•	increasing levels of **stress** (Choii, 2018)

•	**low self-esteem** (O'Moore & Kirkham, 2001; Schäfer et al., 2010)

•	**withdrawn behaviours** (Baldry et al., 2004)

A study with students who had experienced school bulling for a minimum of one year found that bullying victims **internalised the socially constructed ‘victim image’** and the way they thought classmates saw them, even acting upon this image (Thornberg et al., 2011). 

School bullying has also been linked to **high anxiety** at lunch time when potential bullying instance might be higher (Carney et al., 2009). 

A connection has also been shown between school bulling and negative feelings of **self- worth**( Boulton et al., 2010) as well as**negative self-perception** (Mishna et al., 2016), especially in girls (Östberg et al., 2017). 

Seeing as the bully is the perpetrator and the bullying victim is merely the recipient of their behaviour, if either one of them were to feel significant shame one might image it be the bully. 

However, research shows that bullying victims are likely to experience significant **shame** for being a bully victim (Strøm et al., 2018).

This might be because the victim believes that they are at fault for the bullying they experience and that the bullying is a result of their input. 

This makes it more likely that the bully victim would not relate their bullying experiences to others, out of shame for being bullied (DeLara, 2013).

As often misrepresented in popular media, the bully is likely to receive social advantages as a result of their bullying behaviour (Reijntjes et al., 2013).

### :medical_symbol: Physical Health consequences

School bulling victimisation have also been linked to various physical consequences.

A study with 3,377 participants compared self-reported levels of bullying and waist circumference between age 9 and 15. They found that students who reported experiencing school bullying had larger increases in body mass index (BMI). Compared to boys, girls had a larger waist circumference for increased levels of reported bullying. 

Research also found that school bullying victims were more likely to have repeated physical health symptoms (e.g. repeated sore throats, colds, and coughs) (Wolke et al., 2001; Rigby, 2003).

This could be explained by a link between stress and negative psychical health symptoms (Gianaros & Wager, 2015). This connection might be equally as strong, if not stronger with self-directed negative emotions such as shame and negative self-perception, which are things that have been experienced by bullying victims, as discussed above.


## :tornado: Bullying Spiral - Is It the Victims Fault?

Representations of school bulling in popular media are often misleading. The image many people have in their head of a classic bullying interaction often fails to include anything past name calling, physical altercations or momentary humiliation.

In reality however, the actually most difficult consequences of bulling are not the momentary embarrassment or the fleeting uncomfortable experience. 

Instead, it is the lasting social repercussions and the chronic hum of anxiety accompanying the increased likely hood of further bullying altercations or loss of social standing through, for example social group exclusion and the following loss of friends who don’t want to become a bullying target also.

Furthermore, what some argue to be even more devastating is the critical, shameful blaming emotions that the victim directs toward themselves.

Bullying victims are often trapped in a downward spiral started off by a few bulling interactions, that have trickling social repercussions, impacting their social standing is such a way that further bulling behaviours such as exclusion or reputation destruction are more and more likely, the more bullying interactions they receive.

On the way down they will be subjected to harsher interactions the further down they fall on the spiral. 

Bulling victims are often plagued with constant anxiety about this, even though they are not being bullied at that exact moment. 

Stefani Germanotta (Lady Gaga) described how she was bullied at school and recalled not being able to concentrate in class because of how embarrassed she felt.

On top of that, there is an incentive to engage in bulling interactions.

As mentioned in the above section, engaging in bulling other students often leads to improved social standing and lowered likelihoods of to receiving bullying altercations themselves. 

This provides a strong motive for others to engage in some form of bullying behaviour, should an opportunity present itself. 

Someone who has previously been bullied and has suffered the consequent negative social ripple, will present as an easy target for others to bully in order to improve their own social position.

Therefore, the bullying victim will often end up being bullied by a number of others, kicked off by few initial people picking on the victim and others joining in.

This may often not be fully realised by the victim or reflected in the self-directed negative emotions they are suffering under with thoughts such as ‘I am being bullied because I deserve it’ or ‘I am being bullied because of things I did wrong’, ‘I should not tell anyone that I am being bullied because it shows how flawed I am’ etc.

**In other words, bully victims are often bullied as a result of a ripple effect started off by a few bullying interactions, more often so than because of anything specific to them or their input.**

Internalising this realisation could change the life experience of many victims of ongoing or past bullying.

## :speaking_head: How to React to School Bullying?

As a general rule, instead of overcompensating into either an overly offensive or overly agreeable direction, react secure.

When confronted with bullying tactics it can be especially tempting to react either overly offensive by reacting unnaturally aggressive while attempting to defend oneself, or overly agreeable by unconditionally giving in to demands.

Both signal counterproductive unintended messages which can increase bullying rather than reduce it.

### :bow_and_arrow: Reaction to Direct School Bullying Confrontation

Let’s suppose you are faced with direct bullying attacks such as verbal accusations or name calling.  Reacting overly offensive (by e.g., shouting defending statements) signals that you are threatened easily and are fearful that you will not be able to handle the confrontation. This could increase the likelihood of social exclusion.

On the other hand, if you were to react overly agreeable (by e.g., laughing nervously or by being accommodatingly friendly) you signal that you trust other’s input over your own and are easily influenced. This will likely result in this person and others using you by putting you at an disadvantage in line with their own interests.

In contrast, picture the scenario where you react undisturbed and with internal security, deflecting the bystander’s critical attention back to the bully and questioning the bully’s actions rather than yourself. React unfazed, carrying on in your path or task, if appropriate seem slightly humoured and calmy deflect (by e.g., commenting ‘who makes fun of someone’s jacket’). This signals that you have internal security in your own intuition, are not easily intimidated, don’t let momentary emotion influence your rational thinking and are a bad target for bullying.

#### :scroll: SOD Acronym
When confronted with school bullying involving direct attacks or name-calling use the **SOD** acronym:

**Security-** Instead of being fearfully offensive or nervously agreeable, trust in yourself over others who are clearly trying to use you for their gain.

**Outward Unfazed- ** Undisturbed from what you were doing, retain a calm, unthreaded unfazed front.

**Defect-** Defect the bystander’s critical attention back to the bully and questioning the bully’s actions rather than yourself.

### :ninja: Reaction to Indirect School Bullying 

In the case of indirect attacks, reputation destruction or exclusion the approach, is also focused on internal security but nevertheless distinct.

These social environments where bullying is high, often promote a kind of ‘dog eat dog’ mentality where witnesses or those engaging in bullying are less likely to have evoked emotions of empathy for the victim because of generally higher levels of concern for themselves.

Frequently bullying takes place within friend groups, with peers picking on and eventually excluding another person. This will often start off with one person targeting the victim and other members of the friend group joining in. Depending on the victim’s social situation, being excluded from their friend group could make them especially vulnerable to bullying at break and lunch time, when bullying has been reported to be especially likely (Carney et al., 2009). 

In this case, when someone in your school friend group is targeting you and indirectly excluding you, it may be tempting to react overly offensive (by e.g., making them direct aggressive accusations). The tricky thing about indirect bulling is that repeating or mentioning it can be difficult without sounding like one is ‘grasping at straws.’ This can make you seem unstable and insecure, if anything making it more likely that you will be excluded.

On the other hand, if you were to react overly agreeable (by e.g., apologising or making excuses) you may seem nervous and too suggestable to be a stable friend to rely on. This will also make it more likely that you will be excluded rather than prevent it.

In contrast, say you were to avoid the temptation to respond to it directly and thereby dignify the remark, but instead focus the others in the friend group and create a joint discussion involving the other members of the group (by e.g., first engaging a dialogue with one person about something you know they are enthusiastic about and then proceed to actively involve others one at a time). This will reinforce your position in the friend group and responds to the passive aggressive remark, signalling that you don’t take their advance serious.

This however is only one of a variety of unique indirect/ reputation destruction bullying interactions that take place in schools. 

Although this type of school bulling in particular plays out differently in for each individual case, the following steps seem to be the best way to approach them.

#### :scroll: SUP Acronym
When confronted with school bullying involving indirect remarks, rumour or reputation destruction use the **SUP** acronym:

**Security-** Instead of making offensive accusations or agreeable accommodations retain an unthreatened security in yourself.

**Un-dignify-** Resist the temptation to respond directly, dignifying the advance and thereby signalling that you don’t take it seriously.

**Pursue connections-** Focus on engaging with existing connections, reinforcing your social position.

## :flashlight: More Solutions

These external reactions discussed above may be especially helpful, for initial bulling interactions, however, they are unlikely to transform a victim’s situation entirely if they are already far down the spiral and they have already suffered significant social repercussions.

The positive effect of changing the victim’s social environment by for example changing schools, should also not be underestimated (Thornberg et al., 2011).

It can also be helpful to appreciate that bullying may be more common in some schools than others, simply because a vicious circle has encouraged a bullying culture in this particular social environment. As shown by this study (Baldry, 1998) bullying victims may pick on weaker peers and display bullying behaviour themselves, as a sort of defence mechanism, creating a vicious circle encouraging bullying.

Above all, the most impactful is the internal reaction and debunking the self – directed blame.
