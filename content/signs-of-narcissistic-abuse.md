**Narcissistic abuse has been shown to have serious long-lasting impacts, yet most victims are not aware it is happening [^1]**

*Narcissistic abuse is a form of emotional mistreatment and manipulation carried out by a person with narcissistic traits or narcissistic personality disorder. Recognizing narcissistic abuse can help protect from suffering the negative impacts and falling prey to manipulation.*

Five hallmarks of Narcissistic abuse are:
Gaslighting, Lack of Respect for Personal Boundaries, Lack of Empathy, Lack of Emotional Connection, and Lack of Accountability.


## :eye_speech_bubble: Gaslighting

This is one of the most common emotional manipulation tactics used by narcissists. Its main faction is to gain control over others by distorting their perception of reality and making them drought their own thoughts, feelings and memories [^2]. 

Narcissistic gaslighting undermines the victim with tactics such as:

**Denial of events:** The narcissists deny that past events and conversations ever took place in an attempt to me the victim doubt their own recollection.

**Manipulating reality:** The narcissist may twist facts and distort past events in order to suit their agenda and contradict the victim.

**Invalidating:** The narcissist deviates their victim by belittling their judgment, memories and actions to make them doubt their perception and thereby reply on the narcissist.

## :game_die: Lack of Respect for Personal Boundaries

Narcissists often fail to recognize and respect personal boundaries because they prioritize their own interests above all else. This can often manifest as:

**Disregarding consent:** The narcissist fails to ask for agreement or consent to interfere with the victim's life.

**Involving themselves in personal matters:** The narcissist can be uncommonly invasive, involving themselves in personal matters, demanding personal information, and giving directions in inappropriate areas.

**Making entitled demands:** The narcissist often makes excessive demands and propositions demanding the victim’s time, attention, and resources.


## :wind_face: Lack of Empathy

People with narcissistic personality disorder often struggle to feel genuine empathy for others even in their closest relationships creating a barrier for genuine meaningful relationships to form.

Examples of narcissistic lack of empathy can include:

**Disregarding the victim’s interests and feelings:** The narcissist creates a self-cantered representation of reality and makes demands failing to consider the victim's state.

**Fear of looking vulnerable:** Narcissists can view showing empathy as a sign of weakness or vulnerability and therefore avoid it in an attempt to maintain their control.

## :rosette: Lack of Emotional Connection

Narcissism and lack of emotional connection go hand in hand. 

Even in their most intimate relationships, narcissists often lack the ability to have a genuine emotional connection and show:

**Excessive self-focus:** The narcissist is often preoccupied with their own gain and opportunities and desires resulting in an inability to form a genuine meaningful connection based on mutual trust.

**Emotional distancing:** The narcists emotionally distance themselves from others in an attempt to avoid being vulnerable. This is done using, for example, skewed representation of reality and normalizing distance.

**Devaluing others:** Narcissists may devalue others’ emotions and experiences, prioritizing their own. The narcissist may do this by failing to acknowledge expressions of experience and emotions by the victim.

## :open_umbrella: Lack of Accountability

A hallmark of narcissistic abuse is the general inability to take accountability. Narcists often struggle to acknowledge their mistakes or shortcomings of theirs [^3]. Serval factors can contribute to this:

Externalization of blame: Instead of taking associability narcissists may attribute happenings to others or external circumstances.

Defensive responses: When confronted with their actions, narcissists may become defensive, deny any wrongdoing,  deflect criticism and attempt to justify themselves with accusations.

Accountability as an attack on self-worth: The narcissist's inability to take accountability can be rooted in a mindset where taking accountability and admitting wrongdoing equates to accepting lower self-worth.

Individuals in a relationship with a narcissist can leave significant emotional scars, being taken for granted and feeling devalued.
