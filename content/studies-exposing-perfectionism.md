**Generally, popular associations with perfectionism are inconsistent with the true effects indicated by research.**

It has often been an ‘in-joke’ that a job interviewer asks a candidate ‘do you have any weaknesses’ and the interviewee responds ‘only that I’m a perfectionist’. The point being that the interviewee thinks that being a perfectionist is an admirable trait. In actuality, perfectionism shows to have quite contrasting effects.

Here are some research results that demonstrate the impacts of perfectionistic behavior.

## :books: Collecting Unimportant Information

A 2005 study of 28 students suggests that perfectionists collect unimportant information more than non- perfectionists, resulting in perfectionists obtaining lower tests scores than non- perfectionists [(Ishida, 2005)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2005-05565-005/).


## :hourglass_flowing_sand: Wasting Time

A 2011 study where participants were assessed on their ability to proofread, showed that perfectionists were less efficient (wasted more time) than non- perfectionists. Although the perfectionists spend more time on the task, they showed no significant improvement in performance [(Stoeber, 2011)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886910005179?casa_token=0rX6cjAi8TMAAAAA:LFL556IZk8sAAwmTLb_w5GgiCIZS9sIhsiJDl_fRy4iNdSf8LWoUQEI3X_Rr-goL-RlncvvjEw/).


## :arrows_counterclockwise: Connected to Procrastination

This study of 393 students found that students with perfectionism were significantly more likely to engage in various types of procrastination. 
Somewhat unrelated but nevertheless interesting, this study also found that students who were organised and self-determined were less likely to procrastinate [(Burnam et al., 2014)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1041608014001885?casa_token=x7vzYmljIA4AAAAA:Dfz-I87TBKuthgQVpVXIVuEny88bNnvx2niw6qv7mgNj48mSDdzac9uIZJPgiCNW3h6w0u-mwQ/).

A 2017 study of 317 students, assessed participants' perfectionistic concerns over a period of 7 days and found that those with perfectionistic concerns were significantly more likely to practice procrastination [(Smith et al., 2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886917301484?casa_token=f50HcWOw6gQAAAAA:jhT0hql4WCjW__g8PN65AeLc-p7q6uUbMYqgbpdRRkMYVkSZI7_AxceiZhYOBpzPfNDC9L6uMg/).

A study of 200 students showed that participants with higher scores in perfectionism revealed more academic procrastination in comparison with non -perfectionists [(Jadidi et al., 2011)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187704281101929X/).


## :anger: Linked to Worry

This study of 180 students found that those who worried were also much more likely to display perfectionism as well as procrastination. More than anything else, worry was found to be linked to perfectionistic concerns over mistakes and doubts [(Stöber & Joormann, 2001)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1026474715384/).

## :small_red_triangle_down: Lower Goal Satisfaction and Higher Performance Anxiety

A study of 87 professional performers found that those with higher scores of perfectionism were likely to have lower levers of goal satisfaction and greater performance anxiety [(Mor et al., 1995)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02229695/).

## :white_square_button: Contrasting Literature

While appreciating these findings as possible effects of perfectionism, one should also consider that the same roots that cause perfectionism can also be the roots of  positive patterns.

It can be helpful to appreciate that perfectionism may be a very dynamic concept and being classified as a perfectionist clearly does not determine your achievements or experience in a positive nor negative manner.

Some contrasting literature, for a more balanced understanding:

As [(Ocampo et al., 2019)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/job.2400?casa_token=EcxKj7NBqawAAAAA%3AniP4SnfkoeqA2FffQN_OH1PbC3XGxAhuH82uUVSu0m0ebOsbx-_sfo1V-j7eVEcaLsWhTvnpfg4uIQ/) acknowledge, perfectionistic behaviors should be weighed against their drawbacks, perfectionism, under certain conditions or in combination with certain traits, does not always result in detrimental outcomes. As [(Baer & Shaw et al., 2017)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319600056_Falling_in_Love_Again_with_What_We_Do_Academic_Craftsmanship_in_the_Management_Sciences/) asserted, “pursuing perfection is not only an obligation to our community and constituents, it is also an obligation to us. We form ourselves as we work toward perfection. If we tolerate mediocrity, we deny ourselves the opportunity to develop fully”.

Perfectionism linked to high belief of influence over the situation:

A study of 391 primary school administrators found that hight locos of control (the extent to which they believe they have influence over a situation) can be used to predict perfectionism. This suggests that high locus of control is linked to the root of perfectionism [(Kıral, 2015)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042815011891/).

“Perfectionism must be seen as a potent force capable of bringing either intense frustration and paralysis or intense satisfaction and creative contribution, depending on how it is channeled.” [(Schuler, 2002)](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.893.824&rep=rep1&type=pdf/)
