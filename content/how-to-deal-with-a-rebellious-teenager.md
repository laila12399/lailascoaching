**Why do teens rebel? Research has revealed the most effective proven ways of dealing with rebellious teens.**


## :one: Don’t Chase Them
A routine where the parent(s) has to actively approach the teen can increase the likelihood that conflict arises and the teen pushes back. Where possible avoiding chasing after them can save you, the parent(s), pain & reduce conflict occurrences. 

To reduce the amount of conflict, stress, and hurt, a helpful first step is to identify situations that lead to you chasing them to correct something they have or haven’t done. 

Coming up with context-specific setups, which avoid the need for you to chase them, can help the dynamic and improve your and their life experience.

For example, the teen not doing chores is a common cause of conflict [^1] where the parent(s) often are in a situation where they are chasing the teen. One way to prevent you from having to chase the teen could be to configure the Wifi in such a way that it automatically switches off for their devices at a fixed time every day when the teen has to tell you or indicate on a shared document which chores they did, for you to enable the Wifi for their devices. 

The first few times the teen might try to bargain, followed by them doing the chores only after the Wifi switches off, followed by them starting to do the chores only a few minutes before they learn to simply complete the chores before the time at which the Wifi is scheduled to switch off.


## :two: Facilitate an Environment Where They Have to Come To You

If circumstances are set up in a way where the teen has to approach you rather than you being in a situation where you have to chase them, the teen is more likely to be encouraged to communicate constructively. 

This way the teen has time to consider their approach, and they have an incentive[^2] to get their way which facilitates them to dig deeper and come up with constructive actions & communication. 

This way you, the parent(s), can also set a standard for the teen’s behaviors and communication by selecting which types you accept as being, for example, sufficient to reinstate privileges for the teen.

Not only does this save you the anguish of conflict and stress caused when being forced to chase the teen, but it also facilitates an environment encouraging conflict-avoidant constructive behavior in the teen by providing a clear in-the-moment incentive.



## :three: Their Rebellion Is Motivated by Your Knowledge of It

While accusation judgment and criticism may seem like the natural reaction to your teen’s rebellious behavior. 

Rebellious teens have been shown to have a tendency to actively pursue avenues to rebel against the parent(s)[^3], sometimes in an attempt to construct their own identity as a shield against judgment and rejection from the parent(s).

 In many cases, this has been shown to fuel separation between parent(s) and child. Increased identity separation between the teen and parent(s) is likely to be received as rejection by the teen and encourage further rebellion [^4]. 

With a more emotionally immature mind, they can have the tendency to inflate insecurities and concerns, they would likely deem unreasonable in adulthood, such as peer perception [^5]. 

These inflated insecurities and stressors teens are more likely to have, can sometimes result in a frame of mind unaware of wider perspectives or of what they are signaling. In this situation, as parent(s), it can be helpful to appreciate that the teen’s behavior might be over-compensatory and rooted in an insecure sense of self-worth.

## :four: They Are Insecure
The combination of teen’s increased likelihood to be insecure [^6]  and a lower emotional maturity facilitates an individual who is easily fearful of rejection and acts overly defiant as a way of self-protection against rejection or exposing the possible inadequacy of their real/ trying self. 

Incorporating the understanding that your teen’s behavior may be fuelled by fear, can help you not take your teen’s actions personally.  

Without usually being consciously aware of it, teens often try to avoid conforming to their parent's identity in an attempt to reduce the parent’s judgment power of themselves.

## :five: Create Solidarity
When not in direct conflict with the teen, creating solidarity between the teen and self can help the teen open up by soothing their fear of being confronted with an uncomfortable view they think the parent(s) might have of them. 

Shared solidarity between parent(s) and teen can aid in empathetic behavior, increased value in spending shared time, desire to act in aid of each other and is one of the most effective ways to simultaneously reverse rebellion and create prosocial [^7] behavior. 

This could be done by engaging a topic in which the teen and parent(s) have a shared interest or are rooting for a shared outcome. 

If successfully implemented, this will bring to mind a frame in which the teen and parent(s) are in the same in-group rather than the parent(s) and teen being in opposing in-group and out-group. 

## :six: Communicate That You See Value in Them

One common motivation for teens to act rebelliously is to push back against the negative judgment they fear their parent(s) unjustly is or would have on them. The teen's fear that their parent(s) disprove of them often leads to the teen putting up a wall. 

When the parent(s) demonstrate or reaffirm that they see value in something the teen would deem believable, the teen is aided in being more open and letting down their walls. 

This can be as simple as showing them something ‘you think they might like’ – signaling that you place value in what interests them.

For example, you the parent(s), could bring up something or some way the teen has shown to be excelling or proving value. This could be done swiftly by introducing a recent news story and segueing into a topic/ area that excites them or in which they have shown skill. This could range from decorating cakes, predicting movie plots or hackling at the flea market.

This provides an encouraging foundation for them to pursue creating value in other areas and is one of the most effective ways to break down their constricting barrier fuelled by fear of the parent(s) rejecting [^8]  or judging their open/ ‘real’ self as inadequate.


## :seven: Sincerely Describe Your Point of View
Emphasizing 1) What things they are signaling and 2) Clear things they can do on a daily basis to excel. 

Often the teens are not fully aware of the reason behind the parent’s narrative and have been shown to have a tendency to attribute the parent’s attempted guidance to a judgment of themselves [^9]. 

The teen often has a fear of ‘appearing to be trying’ and thereby exposing their ‘true self’ to judgment. This can pose a significant barrier to prosocial and constructive behavior.

When not in direct conflict it can help to describe how you, the parent(s), view the situation by describing specifically which of the teens’ action/ inaction is signaling what, placing this in the context of the parent’s intention. 

Doing this while communicating ‘sincerity’ rather than emotion-driven accusations, increases the chance of information being taken openly. 

Following this, in order to facilitate improvement in respective areas, it can be helpful to specify to the teen actions, signals, and communications they can perform on a daily basis to excel. 

It can be more motivating to the teen to propose what they could do to excel, in a certain area, rather than- barely meeting what is ‘acceptable’.

## :eight: Give Them Responsibility

Depending on the context-specific situation and current place the teen-parent relationship is at, one way of improving things could be to give the teen something they have responsibility over. 

In many cases, this might seem counterintuitive but giving responsibility in one area, does not mean that clear consequences or loss of privileges cannot be enacted in other areas. 

Giving the teen something, they bear responsibility over can provide an avenue for growth. This can provide the teen with something to feel pride in, facilitate improved mutual trust between the parent(s) & teen, and can motivate the teen to apply themselves by having a sense of ownership over progress.

## :nine: Specify Specific Consequences- Before the Line Is Crossed

Having clear consequences to clear lines crossed creates a structure under which the teen is incentivized to act constructively. 

When clear lines are set before the teen is faced with the decision moments of crossing them, the teen is aided in making constructive decisions [^10] even when emotionally charged or crippled by fears and insecurities.

 When the teen is faced with a reliable prediction, of which actions will lead to which consequences, they are able to more clearly envision the resulting situations different decisions will lead to.

Designing the consequences in such a way that the teen can rely upon their interests being met if they act constructively can aid them in improving their routines. 

After identifying a destructive behavior they routinely do, create consequences, such as a  specific reduction in privilege, they can expect.

This way, the teen is confronted with clear results to their actions/ inactions. 

The teen is thereby faced with rationalizations, which only work in their favor if they stay within the lines. 

If consequences, lines, and resulting situations are blurry and merely indicated the teen can be more likely to give into counterproductive tempting behaviors and take the gamble of possible consequences.
