**The most effective weapon against cyberbullying may be in the hands of the victim.**

## :eye: How common is it?

How many adolescents participated in or experience Cyberbullying?

A 2015 Canadian study found 13.99%[^1].

A 2019 US study found 15.5%.[^2].

Female adolescents have been shown to be more likely to report cyberbullying victimization.[^3]

## :calling: Types of cyberbullying 

While definitions of cyberbullying vary greatly, 3 common types of adolescent cyberbullying shown in research can be categorized into exclusion, harassment and trolling behind the target's back.

### :raised_back_of_hand: Exclusion
*This is maybe the most common type of cyberbullying among adolescents.* 

This can occur in a variety of different forms such as creating group chats and purposefully not including the targeted individual, conspiring not to press ‘like’ on the target's posts or unnecessarily cropping the target out of group photos.

### :point_right: Harassment
This is a more direct type of bullying where the goal is to publicly humiliate the target by, for example, posting a demeaning comment on the target’s post. 

Often the bully is playing on an ongoing joke about the target, making it especially difficult to deal with.

### :speaking_head: Trolling behind the target's back
Frequently adolescent cyberbullying happens without the target initially knowing about it. Bullies may share screenshots of the target’s posts in group chats in order to demeaningly joke about the target. 

The target might only learn about this when someone that does not follow them on social media asks them about a post of theirs. This can be deeply unsettling to the target, not knowing what has been said about them and not having control over their own posts.

## :x: What doesn’t work

*Much of the common advice for tackling cyberbullying has been shown to make no difference or in some instances make it worse.*

### :bell: Reporting it to the platform
While most social media platforms have the option to report a post, comment or chat as ‘bullying’ to the platform themselves, this frequently does not solve the problem.
 
Much of adolescent cyberbullying is too subtle or context-specific to be picked up by  social media platforms. 

Furthermore, even if an overtly harassing comment is deleted, this does not improve the sentiment of the bully or stop an ongoing joke about the target from forming and spreading to other social media platforms as well as in-person interactions.

### :loudspeaker: Getting a teacher/authority involved
Asking a teacher to tell the perpetrating cyberbullies off, often does little to improve the situation. On the contrary, this can add fuel to the fire in a number of ways.

For one, in a school, this will draw attention to the original offending behavior, increasing the likelihood that an ongoing joke about the target will be promoted. 

The bullying target will in many cases also receives blaming accusations for reporting an interaction and as a result, get excluded in person and via social media.

## :white_check_mark: What works

Combatting adolescent cyberbullying can be attempted via different domains, however, the three most effective techniques are in: 

1) :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: **the target using counter-tactic to the bullying**
2) :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: **the use of technical hacks**
3) :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: **the target consciously strategizing their social goals**

### :trident: Counter-tactics

The target’s reaction to the cyberbullying can in some circumstances be the fuel that helps it grow or the water that puts it out.

1) :small_orange_diamond: *Don’t interact*

Although it may be tempting, starting a public back-and-forth heated interaction can bring unwanted attention to the incident. 

This can lead to the target being excluded by others in a bid to avoid taking sides or by taking the bully’s side. Not interacting with the provocation attempt can in some contexts prevent encouraging further cyberbullying.


2) :small_orange_diamond: *Avoid emotional blaming statements*

Writing a serious paragraph condemning or pleading with the bully may be counterproductive. Although the motivation behind this might arise out of pro-social intentions that might otherwise be effective in a genuinely close relationship, this is more likely to work against the target in adolescent cyberbullying and circumstances.

The bully’s view of the interaction may be closer to a theatrical performance done for the sake of others watching. Therefore publicly approaching the interaction with emotional blaming statements, may lead to further targeting and exclusion.

Instead, it may be more effective to calmly deflect the bully’s attempt.

3) :small_orange_diamond: *Deflect*

An effective way to counter cyberbullying is to deflect the attempt and throw the critical attention back at the bully.

One way to do this is to respond to the bully with a light-hearted humorous comeback questioning the bully or poking fun at something related that applies to the bullying individual themselves.

This demonstrates security in oneself, ability to handle social situations and can even work in the target's favor, with others being impressed by and supporting the target.

### :globe_with_meridians: Technical hacks

*The way social media is used also can be useful in tackling cyberbullying.*

1) :small_blue_diamond: *Private Social Media Accounts*

Most social media platforms have the option to change one’s account to a ‘private account’. 

On Instagram for example, this means that only users that have been manually confirmed to follow one can see one’s posts. This gives the user more control over who can see and interact with their posts and profile.

2) :small_blue_diamond: *Muting Functions*

Frequently, however, negative individuals are part of one’s followers list and removing them as followers would risk causing rifts or cutting off contacts without explanation. 

A way around this on Instagram is to mute specific users from seeing your posts. The users themselves cannot tell that you have muted them, leaving no need for an explanation. You also have the option to mute users so that their posts are not shown to you, without you needing to unfollow them.

3) :small_blue_diamond: *Evaluate Social Media Platforms*

It can be useful to focus on certain social media platforms over others. 

Depending on which type of cyberbullying is already occurring or is the most likely to occur, focusing on certain social media platforms over others might be helpful. 

Snapchat, for example, alerts the user anytime any other user screenshots or records any of their posts or chat/group chats. This significantly discourages trolling behind the target's back which occurs more frequently on other social media platforms. 

If the target is experiencing exclusion and others are purposely not liking their posts in an attempt to embarrass the target, Instagram by be useful. 

It has the advantage that the user can change their profile picture without automatically creating a post with a ‘like count’ on the followers’ timelines. Instagram and Facebook allow hiding ‘like count’ off posts, removing pressure on the users, which may be usually significant to adolescents. 

*Considering the different features of social media platforms and evaluating which might be the most effective at countering cyberbullying depending on the specific context and threats may be transformative to the target’s experience of social media.*

### :round_pushpin: Strategizing social goals


One of the most devastating impacts of cyberbullying does not seem to be the specific comments/interactions themselves but the anxiety caused within the target about failing socially and possible future bullying interactions. 

One way to address this is to become aware of and adjust the social goals behind using social media. 

To do this, one should evaluate one’s intention behind the different types of interactions one has on social media platforms.

If one, for example, realizes that the only reason that one posts pictures on social media is the attempt to share them with close friends, one could use social media features to ensure only select users can view one’s posts, such as Instagram's ‘friends only story’. 

Becoming aware of and questioning the goals behind interactions can allow one to use social media platforms in such a way that one’s desired outcomes are achieved while still minimizing the likelihood of cyberbullying. 

Furthermore, it is helpful to adjust one’s social goals to where one does not allow oneself to value interactions of others who are trying to use one for their own gain and do not have one’s intentions at heart. *Incorporating this mindset is maybe the most powerful method for becoming robust against cyberbullying*.
