**Is your perfectionism causing your anxiety?**

A common query of perfectionists is whether the anxiety they experience is linked to their perfectionism- and if overcoming their perfectionism would resolve their anxiety.


Perfectionism varies from person to person and has been shown to interact differently with personal traits.[^2]
 
In general, perfectionism seems to be a heightened experience of something most people experience to some degree and dimensions of perfectionism have been shown to have positive impacts as well (see ['Advantages' and 'Disadvantages' of Perfectionism](/advantage-and-disadvantages-of-perfectionism/)).

## :link: Perfectionism Links to Anxiety

Perfectionistic symptoms have frequently been linked to symptoms of psychological distress, including anxiety and possible coping mechanisms such as obsessive-compulsive symptoms[^2].

Different branches of research distinguish between different dimensions of perfectionism. Some dimensions stand out to be particularly linked to anxiety, such as:

➡ 	**Socially Prescribes Perfectionism**

 This is described as the tendency of a perfectionist to believe that others expect high standards of them. This has been reliably linked to Anxiety, especially when there is a potential reputation thread[^5].

➡  **Other-Oriented Perfectionism**

   This describes the tendency to set high expectations for others and to be highly critical when those expectations are not met.
This tendency found in some perfectionists stands out as a dimension linked to higher anxiety[^6].

## :eight_spoked_asterisk: Are Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms a Sign of Perfectionism?

Obsessive-compulsive symptoms have been linked to anxiety[^7], but does it link to perfectionism?

Theories suggest perfectionism develops in an attempt to avoid uncertainty and the coping mechanism of establishing control[^4]. One way perfectionists act on this is by unknowingly obsessively overfocusing on trivial tasks. 

A perfectionist may display obsessive-compulsive symptoms by overly engaging in tasks or checks not crucial to their goals. This seems to be a grasp for control that often leads to inefficient use of time and resources. In essence, this is the over evaluating of small details, instead of considering them in the context of the whole picture.


## :cyclone: Avoidant Coping Perfectionism – How Perfectionism Relates to Anxiety

*One of the most fundamental dimensions of perfectionism can help shed light on the connection between perfectionism and anxiety: Avoidant coping perfectionism.*

### :white_square_button: Active Vs Avoidant
A branch of research separates dimensions of perfectionism where ‘active coping perfectionism’ is describing obsessive problem-solving methods to overcome problems and ‘avoidant coping perfection’ as it is describing disengaging procrastinating tendencies from problems. 

Active coping perfectionism (problem-solving) has been shown to be advantageous to progress [^1].

Avoidant coping perfectionism, however, (directly/ indirectly procrastinating) has been linked to distress[^3].

The same individual may display both active coping and avoidant coping perfectionism at different times.

### :deciduous_tree: The Cause of Avoidant Perfectionism Also Causes Anxiety

As established in [Root Cause of Perfectionism](/root-cause-of-perfectionism/) perfectionism seems to be connected to a fear of not being in control of oneself enough in order to use one’s own abilities to meet one’s aspirations. 

Therefore perfectionists are especially vulnerable to engaging in tendencies where they may over-focus on optimizing trivial details as this also postpones facing their emotional turmoil associated with finishing the task and testing how they are able to apply themselves. 

While perfectionists often hold a narrative of rationally postponing progress to a possibly more ‘ideal’ time, they might simultaneously also experience growing underlying anxiety about not continuing progress and efficiently continuing the task.  

Although from the outside it would maybe seem as though the perfectionist does not have the desire to continue progress efficiently, this seems to be a misinterpretation. Although they are not acting on it, their behavior is not due to an insufficient desire for task progress. 

During procrastination periods the perfectionist is not enjoying distress less bliss but often grapples with unrest about not continuing progress.

Acting on this desire, however, means facing the underlying emotional turmoil associated with testing their performance and completing the task.

These conflicting emotions make it especially tempting for the perfectionist to engage in avoidant procrastinating tendencies. This intern however does not resolve underlying emotional turmoil leading to growing emotional distress.

The struggle of the desire for progress and the resistance to facing the frighting personal assessment of their output encourages disengaging. This disengagement however often results in growing psychological distress of these unresolved contradicting emotions. Often the sufferers themselves aren’t fully aware of the root of their distress. 

For the perfectionist to overcome these tendencies they would also have to manage mentioned emotional turmoil.
