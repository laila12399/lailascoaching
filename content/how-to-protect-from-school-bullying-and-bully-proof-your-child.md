**Trying to find individuals you like builds confidence. Trying to be liked by whoever builds insecurity.**

*What is there to protect bullying victims from?*

Research suggest, instead of the momentary uncomfortable bullying experience, the victim’s self-blaming belief that their input caused the bullying has been shown to be the most detrimental.

With this understanding, in order to protect someone from bullying victimization, which they might inevitably face, the focus should be on the victim’s emotional reaction.


At the center is an individual’s social goal, what their general social intention is. This can facilitate or hinder stable security in oneself, affecting personal traits and life expertise.

**Self-compassionate social goals have been linked to secure and connected feelings white self-image social goals have been linked to loneliness and afraid feelings.**[^1] 

## :busts_in_silhouette: The Two Social Goals

Research suggests there to be two messages 
 you can signal to a child about social situations; one the root of internalizing stress, the other facilitating trust in themselves.

As parents one can greatly influence a child by either:

---

**(1) Sending the message that socializing is about being liked by the maximum number of people**

**or**

**(2) Sending the message that socializing is about finding others one likes and gets along with**

---

Message (2) communicates that the child’s own intuition is not wrong only because some of the random people they’re around, currently don’t reciprocate.
 
## :foggy: Example
*Many times, message one is signaled unintentionally, with good intentions.*

### :spades: Other Oriented Message 1 

Let's take hypothetical 5-year-old Tom. He made friends with kids at the playground and was praised by his parents for having achieved this and being popular.

 A week later with different kids at the playground, Tom again asks kids to play with him but the first few he asked decline. 

Tom now feels he has failed at a task he should succeed at. He feels that there is something he should have done differently, *otherwise* he would not have been praised for succeeding at the same task last week. He is unsure of what he did wrong and decides not to ask any more kids to play with him. 

### :hearts: Self-Compassionate Message 2

5-year-old Jake lives in the neighboring town and also made friends with kids at a playground last week. His parents were happy for him, with there being some kids he liked at the playground that day. 

Today, Jake also wanted to make friends at the playground and asks kids to play with him but the first few he asked declined. Jake understands that there will always be some kids he doesn't get along with at the playground. 

Jake's intention is not to be liked by all other children but to befriend children he likes. Jake asks 3 more kids to play with him and makes friends with one of them.

### :speech_balloon: What Each Message Communicates

Tom feels that making friends should always be his goal and if he succeeds the other kids will befriend him. Jake feels that there are different types of kids, some of them a great match for him to make friends with, others not. 

Tom has internalized the first view, where the other kids are the judge on whether he is liked or not and therefore either a social success or failure. 

Jake has internalized the second view where making friends is not a success/ failure but rather something he chooses to do because he would rather play with that particular person than be alone.
 
Tom's parents communicated that Tom succeeded in obtaining the other kid's approval who let tom be friends with them.
Jake's parents focused their attention on the fact that Jake found kids that he approved of and wanted to be friends with. 

Tom's parents inadvertently recognized the random other kids on the playground as the judge, while Jake's parents recognized Jake's judgment. 
This could lead to Jake developing much stronger confidence in himself and trust in his own intuition than Tom.

## :shield: How Each Plays Out in a Bullying Situation

Both Tom and Jake would find a bullying victimization situation challenging and uncomfortable, but their emotional reactions may differ greatly. 

Tom would be more likely to feel a deep sense of failure in not succeeding socially, take the input from the bullies personally and believe that he is at fault for being in this situation. This could lead him down a road of deep self-hatred and destructiveness. Tom is much more susceptible to developing lasting impacts from the experience, such as low self-esteem, social anxiety and destructive tendencies. 

Jake is more likely to understand that he is around an unfortunate mix of people, that if he were around another mix of people, he would get along with them differently and would be less inclined to take the bullies’ input as serous, knowing that these are not individuals he values. While Jake will find this situation burdening, he is much more likely to be able to maintain confidence in himself and is much less likely to develop lasting impacts from bullying victimization.

## :key: Signaling Self-Compassionate Message 2

*The general signal should imply trust in the child's intuition over that of other children.*

If the child gets ignored by another child, the first message could be signaled by correcting something the child should have done differently such as "try to be more engaging". The second message could be signaled by communicating that this or another child, in the same situation, might have acted differently (e.g., “she might be tired"). 

There should be the understanding that there are different types of people, where some can be more trusted and some being more compatible with one than others.
 
For example, if another child makes fun of your child's t-shirt design, the first message could be signaled by telling the child “Maybe wear a different t-shirt next time". The second message could be signaled by saying "He is in a great mood, isn't he?". 

Furthermore, reacting calm and not too serious can also let the child know that this is not something they need to have a big emotional reaction to and that it is not an unexpected shock that some people might act this way. 

Overall, the only social goal signaled, should be to help the child have a better time, rather than achieving or avoiding social success or failure. 

## :man_playing_water_polo: How to Encourgae Socializing

*One should not confuse encouraging the child to socialize as sending message 1.*

When encouraging the child to socialize, message 2 can be signaled by making clear that the social goal is to find others the child likes and gets along with, not to be ‘liked’ by the maxim number of random strangers. 
One way this could be communicated is by saying "that boy looks like he also likes toy cars, you could play with him if you like".

Communicating that it is not better to be liked by a larger number of people neglecting to consider whether one values them or not. The goal is not to be liked by whoever but find individuals one gets along with.
While view two can be signaled in an infinite number of ways, it is most effective convey through reactions to real events.

Consistency is also impactful and not contradicting it, by for example, agreeing with someone else sending a different message in front of the child.

Consistently communicating message 2 to a child, can help them develop security in their self-perception and own intuition, making them less neurotic and laying the base for trust in themselves that can bring them stability through their whole lives.
