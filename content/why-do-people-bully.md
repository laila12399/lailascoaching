**Is the most devastating impact of being bullied based on a false conclusion?**

*There's a tendency for bullying victims to grossly misinterpret the reason for being bullied, seriously impacting their life experience.*


One of the most devastating consequences the bullying victim may suffer is the belief that they deserve to be bullied. Bullying victims report feeling shame for being bullied [^6] and attribute it to a fault or lacking in themselves.

In actuality, bullying more often than not has more to do with the bully and their incentives rather than the victim.

---

The incentives for people to bully can be categorized into 5 areas:

:speaking_head: **Social Rewards** – Bullies have been found to receive positive social interactions with people who want to be on their side rather than under fire.


:open_umbrella: **Increased Status** - The bully may elevate their status in the social group.


:volcano: **Power Trip** - The bully may view the social group as a competitive environment.


:performing_arts: **Attempt to Feel ‘Better Than’** – Bullying could be an attempt to boost self-esteem.


:paperclips: **Being a Bullying Victim Themselves** - The past victim may attempt to reject the victim image by bullying others themselves.

### :speaking_head: Social Rewards
As often misrepresented in mainstream media, the bully is likely to receive social advantages as a result of their bullying behavior [^1].

People engaging in bullying or related behavior such as exclusion or innuendos may receive social rewards from others in the social group as a result. 

Others in the social group witnessing or having become aware of the bullying, contrary to popular belief, may be ‘nicer’ to the bully or attempt to make friends with them, in order to be their friend rather than their foe. 

To side with the bully and be in their good graces, others may subtly join in bullying the victim as a way of becoming closer with the bully and thereby distancing themselves from the line of fire.

Bullies may also be less likely to be targeted with negative social attention, adding further incentive for people to bully.

### :open_umbrella: Increased Status

Kicking someone down can be done in an attempt to protect their own standing in the social group. 
Engaging in bullying behavior has been shown to be linked to increased status in the social group [^2]

People may target someone else as a result of being scared of being a target or being left out themselves. Bullying the victim and drawing critical attention to them, inadvertently also draws negative attention away from themselves and puts them one less person away from the ‘bottom’. 
Others may be joining in and supporting the bully with the same incentive, saturating critical attention on one person and thereby drawing it away from themselves. The people bullying the target may do so with an insecure ‘you rather than me’ mentality.

### :volcano: Power Trip
The bully may have the personal incentive to be proud of being socially ‘successful’ in their own eyes. 
People engaging in bullying may be more likely to see their social environment as a competitive situation, with less focus on individual connections and more on attempting to master a hierarchy. 
They might bully with the perception that making someone else the ‘loser’ makes them the ‘winner’. Therefore, the individual that happens to be the bullying target might be less important to them than their incentive of being able to view themselves in a certain light. 


### :performing_arts: Attempt to Feel ‘Better Than’

One incitive the bully may have is to attempt to make themselves feel ‘better than’ they currently do by making someone else feel worse about themselves. 

The bully may bully the target simply because they want to change the way they feel about themselves. Making someone else out to be faulty or not ‘good enough’ can draw their own attention from their insecurities and may simply be an attempt to soothe their own mental turmoil. 

Often the bully has areas of insecurity that they themselves have negative feelings about. With the intention of both making themselves feel better and in the attempt to combat the fear of others discovering their areas of insecurity they have the incentive to shine critical attention elsewhere.


### :paperclips: Being a Bullying Victim Themselves

bullying victims may pick on weaker peers and display bullying behavior themselves, as a sort of defense mechanism, creating a vicious circle encouraging bullying [^3]. 

 The bullying victim may bully in an attempt to boost their self-esteem, which has been hurt as a result of being bullied [^4]. 
Being bullied may make the victim feel unsafe in the social group, decreasing their empathy [^5] for others and making it easier to bully.

The bullying victim may also want to repair the social image that they may perceive as damaged by being bullied and want to reject the victim -image in front of themselves.

The combination of incentives, together with a decreased sensitivity for empathy with others as a result of feeling unsafe themselves makes it more likely that someone who was bullied in the past becomes the perpetrator themselves.

##  :shield: How this helps the bullying victim

Understanding the bully’s true intentions disproves the bullying victim’s most crippling conclusion.

Research shows that bullying victims are likely to experience significant shame for being a bullying victim [^6].

The shame being drawn from the conclusion that they deserve to be bullied because of something that's ‘wrong’ with them.

Were the bullying victim to understand these intentions and become aware of the underlying motivations of the bully and others supporting the bully, the victim would be more likely to be able to sustain the bullying without being personally affected or hurt by it.

The most effective way to help bullying victims may be to aid them to understand that being a bullying target is not their fault.
