**There are certain characteristics and behaviors which have been proven to make women attracted to or put off men.**

*Likelihood has it, you are already engaging in some.*

## :large_blue_circle: Dos That Most Aren’t Aware Of:

### :one: Secure Character 

If you had to pick a person to get approval from, would you want someone who knows what they value?

If you had to align with someone, would you want someone secure enough to act on principles?

If you had to trust someone would you want them to trust themselves?

Why would most answer yes to all of these questions? Because it increases the value of the approval because trust inspires respect, and because it makes an allegiance more valuable.

One of the most attractive things you can signal is that your actions, thoughts, and perspectives are not easily swayed, pushed, and pulled into different directions. 

The most effective way to signal this is by demonstrating that you possess a self-governed mind. 

Signaling this shows that you trust in yourself, that you are confident in your own ability to understand things, and that you are consistent in the way you act and think rather than hypocritical.

For her to want to be with you, get your approval, and align with you, one of the most fundamental things to establish is for her to be able to see the value in you.

When you present like a secure stable person who is able to be relied upon, you inspire trust. 

Perceived trustworthiness has been shown to increase perceived make attractiveness to women [^1].

One way that stable secure characters are appreciated is when they are seen as someone who is principle-based, able to prioritize, and secure enough to be okay with not being liked by most.


### :two: Witty Awareness

Demonstrating that you are a capable intelligent individual is one of the most important things to signal in order to be perceived as attractive, and as someone whose attention is meaning full.

One of the most desired characteristics is someone who appears to have the potential to handle challenges & has the potential to win results. 

A witty awareness is often shown when someone is able to pick up on inferred meanings, place things into context, isn’t easily intimidated or impressed by superficial momentary things.

The mere impression that you appear to be able to pick up on things and come up with witty approaches, makes you seem like a sharp credible, and capable individual.  

Being able to distinguish literal, inferred meanings and connected frames of mind and concepts demonstrates that you are perceptive and acute.

Women have been shown to be more attracted to males indicating a problem-solving ability [^2].

Successfully demonstrating a witty awareness makes you seem like a capable individual who she wants on one’s side.

 
### :three:	Full of Life

What’s the most fundamentally attractive? Health. 

One characteristic that is often attributed to a healthy person is someone full of life.

This could mean being able to aspire, being innovative, humorous, daring, analytical, optimistic, and not easily discouraged.

One way this is signaled is when a person shows that they have their own thoughts & conclusions separate from what they think ’most people would do’. 

Don’t be afraid of doing something out of the usual, stepping out of expected routine or common practice, this can actually work in your favor.


### :four:	Take Social Risk

Indicating your interest in front of others, makes you seem secure in yourself and demonstrates one of the most attractive things; a courageous determined attitude- towards her.

Willingness to take social risks has been repeatedly shown to be particularly effective in inspiring reciprocal attraction [^3].

Some might be afraid that any forward show of interest or social risk would seem too eager. 

In actuality, it can make you appear secure in yourself, bold in character, and makes her feel like  ‘you are able to see her as special.’

On top of that, it makes it seem as though you believe that it is reasonable that she would respond to the advances.

It makes you seem like someone who has interests in her in particular, making her feel appreciated and you an attractive choice. 

After properly acting in line with these, it is difficult for you not to stick in her mind.

## :red_circle: Don’ts That Many Are Tempted By:

### :one:	Don’t Appear to Be Changing Yourself

Some signal their own insecurity when they appear to present altered from what they really think and what their real tendencies are.

Many are tempted to mask and try to change their impression to what they think is something expected and/ or desired. 

Appearing to be doing this, gives the impression that one believes one’s true self to be ‘not good enough’ and signals the need to play a role to improve one's value. 

### :two:	Don’t Prioritize Social Gain Over Her

Some are weary of making sure that they look like they get along with others around, to look good in front of her. However, neglecting her or even exposing things she told you in a desperate attempt to make more social connections when with others, is an easy way to make you an unattractive choice.

Not being able to maneuver priorities while trying to work on your social standing with others, reduces the value of your prosocial behavior and signals that you need social approval from others.

This can make it seem as though you lack personal standards for being able to differentiate between people. 

Doing so signals that you are engaging her not for a personal reason but for the reason that you try to be liked by everyone. 

This can easily signal that you are an unreliable person who might not be able to prioritize people and/ or is not socially aware enough to understand unspoken meanings.

 This makes you seem like you lack perception, making you less attractive as well as a strategically bad choice of person to align with.

### :three:	Don’t Show or Engage Interest in Other Women

Some arrive at the notion that having the attention from several women at the same time makes them appear more desired and would thereby increase their chance of getting the one they really want.

 However, in actuality, this decreases the sincerity and value of your attention, making it seem as though you are easily impressed and lack an ability to differentiate between people.

This also makes you seem like a feeble choice to align with, as it makes it seem as though your interest could be easily swayed.

Maybe most detrimental, this can make you appear like a less decisive and desperate person, who is not sure what they want. 

### :four:	Don’t Be Afraid to Be Protective
While some are afraid to appear protective or signal concern for her, this is not something that should be actively avoided.

In many cases showing concern for her is more likely to make her more attracted to you,  be enticed by how you view her, and make her want to be around you.

Signaling that you have her well-being in mind, shows that you’re able to think ahead and are aware of details. 

In this way,  you signal that you don’t shy from a position of responsibility, inspiring respect and trust.
